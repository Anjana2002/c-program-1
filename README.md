#***QUESTIONS***

1)***area.c :-***
           If the lengths of three sides of a triangle are input through the keyboard, write a program to find the area of the triangle.<br />
           <br />
2)***reverse.c:-***
            If a five-digit positive integer is entered through the keyboard, write a program to reverse the number. Display an error message if the number entered             is not a valid five digit number.<br />
            <br />
3)***interchange.c:-***
            Write a program to accept two numbers and place them in two variables a and b. Interchange their values and display the result.<br />
            <br />
4)***five.c:-***
            If a five-digit positive integer is entered through the keyboard, write a program to calculate the sum of its digits. Display an error message if the               number entered is not a valid five digit number.<br />
            <br />
5)***wcf.c:-***  
            Wind chill factor (wcf) is the felt air temperature on exposed skin due to wind. The wind chill temperature is always lower than the air temperature                 and is calculated as follows<br />
                         wcf = 35.74 + 0.6215t + (0.4275t - 35.75) * v0.16<br />
            where v is wind velocity and t is the temperature. Write a program to receive the values of v and t and find the wind chill factor (wcf).<br />
            <br />
6)***distance.c:-***
             Write a program to receive values of latitude (L1,L2) and longitude(G1,G2) in degrees of two places on earth and output the distance (D) in nautical                miles. The formula for the distance in nautical miles is
                       D = 3963 cos-1(sin L1 sin L2 + cos L1 cos L2 * cos(G2-G1))<br />
                       <br />
7)***rectangle.c:-***
             Given the length and breadth of a rectangle, write a program to find whether the area of the rectangle is greater than its perimeter.<br />
             <br />
8)***triangle.c:-***
              Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle are entered through the keyboard. A triangle is                   valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.<br />
              <br />
9)***line.c:-***
             Given three points (x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x3,y3), write a program to check if all the three points fall on one straight line.<br />
             <br />
10)***point.c:-***
             Given a point (x,y), write a program to find out if it lies on the X-axis, Y-axis or on the origin.<br />
            <br />
11)***prime.c:-***
             Checking whether the number is prime or not.<br />  
             <br />
12)***cuberoot.c:-***
             Write a program to find the cube root of an integer. If the input is not a perfect cube, display the number is not a perfect cube.<br />
             <br />
13)***rupees.c:-***
             Consider a currency system in which there are notes of seven denominations, namely Re 1., Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50 and Rs. 100. If a sum of Rs. N is entered through the keyboard, write a program to compute the smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs. N.<br />
             <br />
14)***circle.c:-***
              Given the coordinates (x,y) of the centre of a circle and its radius, write a program that will determine whether a point lies inside the circle, on the circle or outside the circle.<br />
              <br />
15)***price.c:-***
              If the cost price and selling price of an item are input through the keyboard, write a program to determine whether the seller has made profit or incurred loss. Also determine how much profit he made or loss he incurred.<br />
              <br />
16)***fibo.c:-***
